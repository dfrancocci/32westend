# New bathroom

To facilitate the demolition of the existing bathroom in the ground floor extension, a new bathroom was created on the first floor. This required:

- New connection to mains sewage at the front of the house. 
- New mains water supply at the front of the house. 
- Partition of the front bedroom - fitting a new bathroom and installation of a hot water system housed in the bedroom and loft. 

This is a diagram showing the new sewage connection and new mains water connection at the front of the house.
